DeStore Network, a marketplace for Phygital Assets

Objective: 

The DeStore platform aims to facilitate the adoption and management of phygital assets, which are physical assets connected to a digital twin. By utilizing smart contracts and blockchain technology, DeStore enables the creation, management, and trading of these assets, with the goal of providing pathways for small to medium enterprises (SMEs), creators, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to expand their brand and sell real-world products on web 3.0 infrastructure.

Methods:

The platform utilizes digital twins and tokenization to represent physical assets. Digital twins allow for real-time monitoring and analysis of assets, while tokenization enables the creation of smart contracts for efficient automation of processes and reduced need for intermediaries. By linking multiple digital files to a single asset, the platform allows for flexibility in representation on different platforms.

Expected Outcomes: 

The widespread adoption of phygital assets and platforms like DeStore has the potential to greatly impact the way physical assets are managed and utilized. Real-time monitoring and optimization of performance, maintenance, and operation of assets can be achieved, as well as the autonomy of exchanging all product information at the point of sale of underlying assets.

Impact:

The DeStore platform and the wider adoption of phygital assets can lead to reduced costs and increased efficiency in the SME economy, creator economy, and DAO economy. Furthermore, this platform can potentially revolutionize the way we manage and utilize our physical assets.
